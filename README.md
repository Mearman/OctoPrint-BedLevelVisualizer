# OctoPrint-BedLevelVisualizer

This plugin visualises the output from various firmware that support bed mesh leveling, noteably the Prusa `G81` mesh leveling report and the Marlin `G29 T` bed topography report. The plugin utilizes [Plotly](https://plot.ly/plotly-js-scientific-d3-charting-library/) js library to render a 3D surface of the bed's reported mesh on a tab within OctoPrint.

## Supported Firmware:

- Marlin 2.0.5.3
- Prusa i3 MK2 to MK3S version 3.2.3 to 3.8.1
- Klipper
- Older Marlin and Repetier firmware.

## Example

It converts this:

## Known Issues

- Since version 0.1.3 there is a python dependency on numpy. As a result; if you don't already have numpy the install can take in excess of 30 minutes to complete on a pi. Just be patient and let it run and eventually the plugin install will finish.
- If your device have less than 512MB of ram your numpy installation would most likely fail. See [#141](https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-BedLevelVisualizer/issues/141#issuecomment-542227338) for solution.
- If you have Marlin's Auto Temperature Reporting Feature enabled you will want to have M155 S30 and M155 S3 surrounding your G29 command, see settings screenshot, otherwise the collected data will be tainted.
- ~~Currently there is a conflict with the TempsGraph plugin. If you have this plugin installed you will receive an error that Plotyle.react is not a function. There is a version update pending on that plugin to resolve this issue, just waiting on the author to release.~~ Resolved with TempsGraph release [0.3.3](https://github.com/1r0b1n0/OctoPrint-Tempsgraph/releases/tag/0.3.3).

- Plotly library to version 1.52.2

**[0.1.11]** (10/06/2019)

**Added**

- Python 3 compatibility.

**[0.1.10]** (08/22/2019)

**Added**

- Option for ignoring Bed Level Correction Matrix.

**[0.1.9]** (06/15/2019)

**Fixed**

- Issue where ABL_BILINEAR_SUBDIVISION in Marlin was not graphing correctly. Now the mesh will be reset to an empty set if the phrase `Subdivided with CATMULL ROM Leveling Grid:` is received and continue mesh collection of points.

**[0.1.8]** (05/26/2019)

**Added**

- Add grid boundary detection and auto flipping for UBL reports, possibly others, for more accurately defined probing points and bed orientation.

**Fixed**

- Fix minor bug where lines w/ `1 |[+0.019] -0.137` are not matched.

**Thanks**

- Thanks to [@gandy92](https://github.com/gandy92) for the above changes.

**[0.1.7]** (11/24/2018)

**Added**

- New timeout setting that will unlock `processing` UI after given seconds. If processing takes longer to complete due to full probing requirements or some other reason set this to a higher value.
- Toggle button in toolbar to enable click events on surface to move the hot end to that position.

**[0.1.6]** (09/06/2018)

**Added**

- Repetier firmware support thanks to @gztproject.

**[0.1.5]** (09/03/2018)

**Added**

- Option to make center of bed the origin point per request. Helpful when using a fixed center leveling system as described [here](https://github.com/PrusaOwners/prusaowners/wiki/Bed_Leveling_without_Wave_Springs).
- Option to make measured offsets relative to origin position, related to above addition but could be useful elsewhere.

**Changed**

- X/Y axis calculations to resolve bug discovered during above changes where if your leveling grid was based on an odd number of probe points the maximum perimeters were getting dropped due to rounding errors.

**[0.1.4]** (08/06/2018)

**Fixed**

- Issue introduced with previous update that was causing some leveling reports to not be identified correctly.

**[0.1.3]** (08/05/2018)

**Added**

- Recognition of older bed reports to work for some users. Should now work with reports that return lines like `Bed x: 40.00 y: 20.00 z: 7.31`.

**[0.1.2]** (06/09/2018)

**Added**

- Display of last mesh timestamp above Update button.

**[0.1.1]** (06/01/2018)
